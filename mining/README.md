## mTunnel
Let turtles do the "heavy lifting" for your branch mine.

####Description:
> Turtle digs the main tunnel, and branches of a mine. Leaving you to run down the branches to grab up all the good stuff.

> Digs a 3 wide, 2 tall main tunnel in the direction it's facing at start of program. Every 2 blocks it will created a "tunnel pair" (number of "tunnel pairs" are defined by your input at beginning of program. This is a tunnel to the left and right of main. The length of the side tunnel are defined by your input at the beginning of program (1 = 10 blocks, this will be changed). At this time, the turtle will dig a whole in the side of the "tunnel pair" every 10 blocks and place a torch (this will be changed as it leaves 1 block of spawnable area between torches).

####ToDo List
- [ ] Add/Update code documentation.
- [ ] Adjust torch place to be every 9 blocks.
- [ ] Change "tunnel pairs" to be defined by total length in blocks (1 = 1)
- [ ]

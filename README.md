Turtle contorlled tree farm using the ComputerCraft mod for Minecraft

##Disclaimer:
I'm not an experienced programmer by any means! Anything you do with this program you do at your own risk. This was just a way for me to play around with something simple. I'm continuing to test and refine the program as I learn more. If you have any suggestions, or run into any bugs, please feel free to report/fork them.

##Description:
- This program will allow you to create a tree farm to any dimension. 
- The turle will create the farm forward (direction the turtle is facing), and to the left of it's current postion when starting the program.
- If it's a new farm, the turtle will first created a borader around the farm. If it's an existing farm, the turtle will go into a 'processing' mode and skip the boarder.

##ToDo:
- [ ] Finish initial code documentation.
- [ ] Add debug/testing veriable.
- [ ] Add veriable tree spacing.

## rpQuarry
Computer controlled, horizontal, RedPower2 frame quarry.

####Description:
> This was created to control the frame quarry I built on a friends server. (Will add picture later) The frame quarry was built in a MystCraft flat world. Using two stacks of RP2 block breakers from bedrock to above surface. 

> It starts on the left side of the quarry and moves right, breaking a full row of blocks from surface to bedrock at a time. There are two turtles on the sides of the frame that detect when it has reaches the end of the quarry. This allows for an unlimited size (in theory). Once it reaches a side, the quarry moves forward one block, then begins the process again in the opposite direction.
